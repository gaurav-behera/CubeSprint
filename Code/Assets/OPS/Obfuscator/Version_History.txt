5.0

== Obfuscator 5.0 Introduction ==
The Obfuscator 5.0 version optimizes the MonoBehaviour protection and brings the obfuscation through
new features on a new level. By introducing ControlFlow Obfuscation, method bodies will be scrambled
and transformed into a nearly human unreadable form. An also new feature is the AntiTampering Obfuscation.
This feature builds a system of micro-checks to prevent modification and keeps hacker away.

4.0.6:
- Fix: Building Addressable Assets will no longer trigger the obfuscator and a so failed build.

4.0.5:
- Fix: ArgumentException: ... Type .. has no scope?

4.0.4:
- Fix: On Analyse Scenes / Components - MissingMethodException.
- Fix: Enum wont be obfuscated if 'Obfuscate Serializable Classes' is deactivated.

4.0.3
- Fix: While processing pre build pipeline: System.MissingMethodException

4.0.2
- Fix: InvalidCastException while analysing assemblies.
- Fix: Yaml failed deserialization while analysing assets.

4.0.1
- Add: EventTrigger inspector method will now be recognized too.

4.0

== Obfuscator 4.0 Introduction ==

The Obfuscator 4.0 version is a bottom up new implemented Obfuscator, to increase the performance, security and
compatibility to Unity 2018+ versions. For you the process keeps the same. The Obfuscator still automatically applies
the obfuscation at build time. The Setting and Error-Stack-Track windows got a face lifting to be more intuitive and easier
to use. The settings and rename-mapping are now stored in a Json serialized file. This means for you,
because of the modification and the extension of the settings, you have to readjust the settings in the settings window.
It is not necessary to change the rename-mapping files. They will still be normally interpreted. But new rename-mappings
will be stored in the new Json format.

Most important obfuscation changes:
- You have more options to decide which assemblies you want to obfuscate.
- The string obfuscation is now way more advanced. (Pro only)
- The obfuscation of MonoBehaviour/ScriptableObject/Playable subclasses is way more advanced too. (Pro only)
- Also inspector set values / methods are now even better recognized.
